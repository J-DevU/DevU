Hello!

I'm Jenny. Little bit about me, my interest ranges in technology and the aerospace industry in the areas of supply chain, engineering, and data analytics.

I want to help people (like you!) be aware and build their foundation skills to get their foot in the door, ultimately, be one step closer to their dream career!

Being first-generation and coming from a low-income family, I had to figure out a lot of things on my own. I want my blog to be a resource you can use to learn and achieve your goals. My blog will consist of materials covering career preparation and my personal career interests. Look out for valuable advice, tutorials, and random fun facts!
